# TASK 10-If Maths was Fun

### Question

Given a function f(x) find its minimum value over the range 0<x<π/2


$$
f(x)=(x^2+bx+c)/sin(x)
$$


### Input

- First-line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains a single line of input, two real numbers b,c.

### Output:

For each test case, output the minimum value of f(x)over the given range. Absolute error of 
$$
(10^-6)
$$
 is allowed.

### Constraints

- 1≤T≤100000

- 1≤b,c≤20
