# Task 2- Debugging Derbies

### Question

Lenna was just trying to make a quiz application for maths using java. But she seems to be facing alot of issues in the code that she wrote. Could you go through the code and find out all tthe mistakes and fix them for her?

### Answer

We were supposed to get the code from running 

$wget-o MathQuiz.java https://tiny.cc/cognizance-task2

I noticed that the first error was being committed in the first few kines of the program in which the import java.awt.Font was being commented. The next was I renamed public class MathQuiz to public class Main() and similarly I changed Mathjava to main in public static void declaration.

Also the multiplication operator was changed to addition operator and vice versa. And there was a function named questionLabel missing from one of the stages and was supposed to be corrected.
